Test kramdown math -> KaTeX rendering
=====================================

Processed by Jekyll into https://cben.github.io/sandbox/katex

KaTeX loaded in output via Jekyll template `_layouts/katex.html`.

Delimiters [recognized by kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#math-blocks):

inline $$ \frac{kram}{down} \sum_0^\infty $$ text.

$$ \frac{kram}{down} \sum_0^\infty $$

The second is display math because it occurs alone in a block.
